This repository is here to collect information about the yt's
participation in google summer of code 2018.

You can find more information about yt on our website: http://yt-project.org

Code development for yt happens on GitHub: http://github.com/yt-project/yt

## Project Ideas

* [Interpolating particle data onto grids](https://github.com/yt-project/gsoc-2018/tree/master/ideas/sph-smoothing.md)
* 

## Communication

Formal discussion about google summer of code should happen on [the
yt-dev mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-dev.python.org/). We
also have a slack community for informal discussion that you can
request access to once you formally introduce yourself to the
community. All project communication must obey the [yt community code
of
conduct](http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/developing/developing.html#yt-community-code-of-conduct).

## Contribution

Code development for yt happens in the open on GitHub, following
standard open source software practices. If you would like to get
started with an issue, please see our [bug
tracker](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues), in particular bugs
that are tagged [new-contributor
friendly](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+contributor+friendly%22). If
you have other questions please see the [yt developer
guide](http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/developing/index.html) for
detailed information about setting up a development environment and
contributing to yt.

## Applying

If you are interested in participating, follow these steps:

1. **Read over the [GSoC 2018 site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)**
to understand better how the program works and whether you are eligible to
participate.


2. **Take a look at the yt ideas list and pick a project that matches your skills and interest**. You will increase your chances of being selected if you familiarize yourself with the project idea and show a good understanding of it when you contact the yt developers. What matters is not how hard the project is, but how well matched you are to the project.

3. **Join our mailing list, [yt-dev](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-dev.python.org/), introduce yourself, and let us know of your interest**, so that we can pair you up with a prospective mentor to help you prepare your application.

4. **Take a look at the [open yt issues](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues/)**, pick an issue that is not being worked on. Leave a comment that you will be attempting to solve the issue, and attempt to solve the issue. You will need to build yt from source, set up a development environment, and debug the issue. Once you have a fix, **[open a pull request on GitHub](http://yt-project.org/doc/developing/developing.html#making-and-sharing-changes)**.

5. **Create a blog** so your mentors and others in the project can keep track
of your progress. This blog will be updated throughout your summer of code internship if you are selected.

6. **Start working on your application**. If you would like us to give feedback
on your application, please create a copy of the `template.md` file a new with the name ``<Your Name>:<Project Name>.md`` and fill out the template.

The [student guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/ch008_writing-a-proposal/) and [Sympy Application Template](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2016-Application-Template) also provide some additional advice on preparing your application.

Give yourself plenty of time to work on the application. Please also contact the primary mentor listed on the project idea so that the mentor can look over your application and give you feedback before submission.

7. **Submit your application** via the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) site! Let your potential mentors
know once you have done this so they can give it a final look over.

### Recommendations

1. **Take the initiative** - we can send you information on the projects and
feedback on the applications, but it is your responsibility to ask the
questions and start preparing your application. We will let you know if something is missing from your application or if any of the goals are unrealistic, but we will not write the application.


2. **Use yt** - you will gain a much better understanding of how yt works by actually using it. Download it, install it, and follow some of the examples in the documentation, to get a better idea of what it can do.

3. **Familiarize yourself with the development guidelines for yt**. The
[developer guide](http://yt-project.org/doc/developing/index.html) contains a
lot of information on how to contribute to yt using git and GitHub, how to
navigate the codebase, how to write tests, documentation, etc. The more
understanding of the workflow you can demonstrate, the better your chances.
